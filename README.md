Overall, I found this article to be very intersting because it hightlights a perspective regarding careers in computer science that I don't think about very often. When I chose to study computer science, I was excited at the prospect of having a very wide variety of options for what I could with my degree after graduation. It also felt like a very safe option, considering the growth the industry has been experiencing in recent years. 
However, this article was a reminder of quickly the industry itself is evolving to accommodate goals such as AI programming tools. Although the article describes the ways in which AI programming tools fall short when compared to humans, I can't help but wonder how long it will be until those challenges are overcome. How might a 'human level' AI programming tool affect the industry?
